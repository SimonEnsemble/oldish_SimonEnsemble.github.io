We leverage machine learning, statistical mechanics, mathematical modeling, and molecular simulations to accelerate the discovery and deployment of nano-porous materials for gas storage, separations, and sensing. Our efforts directly contribute to the development of novel materials and technologies, the provision of cheaper and cleaner energy, and the enhancement of national security.

### nano-porous materials

Nano-porous materials, such as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and porous cage molecules, exhibit large internal surface areas. 
Both the pore geometry and the chemistry of the internal surface are tunable.
As a consequence, nano-porous materials can be tuned to selectively adsorb different gas molecules for engineering applications involving the storage, separation, and detection of gases. We work on the following applications:
* storing (densifying) natural gas onboard vehicles for fuel
* capturing radioactive isotopes of noble gases that evolve into the air during the reprocessing of used nuclear fuel
* sensing pollutants in outdoor air

For example, the MOF Ni(pyz)$_2$SiF$_6$ consists of Ni metal nodes, pyrazine linkers, and SiF$_6$ pillars; by changing the metal, linker, and pillar, one fine-tune this pillared MOF.

### machine learning

We use machine learning algorithms to predict the adsorption properties of nano-porous materials and automatically cluster together nano-porous materials with similar adsorption properties.

### molecular modeling and simulation

In virtual high-throughput screenings, we build computer models of hypothetical materials that have not been synthesized, then employ molecular models and simulations of gas adsorption to predict their adsorption properties. 
The goals are to shortlist materials on which to focus experimental investigation and elucidate relationships between the structure the material and its properties. 
We also use molecular models and simulations of gas adsorption to identify the most prominent gas adsorption sites in a material and understand how its structure gives rise to its adsorption properties.

### mathematical modeling of gas sensor arrays

In a gas sensor array, we monitor the adsorbed mass of gas in a set of diverse MOFs; changes in the gas composition cause changes in the adsorbed mass in each MOF.
We develop statistical and mathematical models of gas sensor arrays to 
(i) parse the information-rich, high-dimensional response pattern of the sensor array and 
(ii) select the optimal combination of MOFs for the array.

### statistical mechanical modeling

We develop parsimonious but illuminating statistical mechanical models of gas adsorption in flexible/dynamic MOFs that can undergo structural changes upon the adsorption of gas. 
Our goal is to reveal insights into the adsorption properties of such MOFs and uncover any anomalous adsorption properties we could exploit for adsorption-based engineering applications.
