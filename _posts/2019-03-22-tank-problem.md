Liquid continuously flows into a truncated square pyramidal tank at a rate $q_i=q_i(t)$ [m$^3$/s]. Hydrostatic pressure drives flow out of the tank through a narrow pipe at its base; via Bernoulli's equation, the outlet flow rate $q\propto \sqrt{h}$, where $h$ [m] is the liquid level in the tank.

The goal here is to derive a dynamic model for the liquid level $h=h(t)$ given any input $q_i(t)$. The outlet flow rate then follows as $c\sqrt{h(t)}$. The proportionality constant $c$ is a characteristic of the liquid in the tank and the geometry of the exit line; it can be measured experimentally.

Taking the liquid as incompressible, a mass balance (system boundary: the tank) implies a volume balance:

{:.centerr}
$\dfrac{dV}{dt}=q_i-c\sqrt{h}$

where $V=V(t)$ is the volume of liquid in the tank at time $t$. This differential equation is intuitive if we multiply it by $dt$. Within a differential time window $dt$, we can view $q_i(t)$ and $h(t)$ as constant. In a differential time span $dt$: the amount of liquid that entered the tank is $q_idt$; the amount of liquid that exited the tank is $c\sqrt{h}dt$; the change in volume $dV$ of liquid in the tank within the differential time span $dt$ then must be $(q_i - c\sqrt{h})dt$.

The [agnostic to tank geometry] volume balance as written is not so helpful. It cannot be directly solved since $V$ is coupled to $h$ through the tank geometry, i.e., $V=V(h)$. Consider $q_i$ and $h$ known at a given moment. Then, the volume of liquid in the tank will change by $dV = (q_i - c\sqrt{h})dt$ after a differential time $dt$. But changing the volume will in turn change the liquid level $h$. So, to compute $dV$ at the _next_ time step, we'd need to know how $h$ changed after we incremented the volume by $dV$ in the first step. This is where the tank geometry comes in.

Consider when the liquid level changes by a differential length $dh$. This corresponds to adding a small slice of liquid whose volume is $dV$. We relate $dV$ and $dh$ through the area $A$ of the added slice of liquid from the helicopter view; $dV=Adh$ since, with such a thin slice, the areas of the bottom and top of the slice are the same. Generally, $A=A(h)$, as is the case for our tank geometry since the area from the helicopter view is larger for smaller liquid levels.

Therefore, a more helpful volume balance is:

{:.centerr}
$A(h)\dfrac{dh}{dt}=q_i-c\sqrt{h}$

and is well-posed if we can find how the area from a helicopter view varies with $h$ in the tank geometry. This is the key to solving all tank problems of this nature, regardless of the tank geometry. We now impose our particular tank geometry to find $A(h)$ and complete the dynamic, differential equation model for $h(t)$.

A little more about our truncated square pyramidal tank. The view from all four sides is equivalent and is below. Its height is $H$ [m]. The top and bottom base are of length $L_t$ and $L_b$ [m], respectively. All horizontal slices through the tank reveal a square cross-section. This is a _right pyramid_, meaning that its apex (if it weren't truncated) is directly above the centroid of its base.

{:.centerr}

If we define $w=w(h)$ [m] to be the length of the line that the top of the liquid makes from a side view, then the area is simply $A(h)=[w(h)]^2$.

{:.centerr}
<figure>
    <img src="/images/tank_problem/tank_2.png" alt="image" style="width: 50%;">
</figure>

We can relate $w$ to the liquid level $h$, height of the tank $H$, and lengths of the bases $L_t$ and $L_b$ if we draw some right triangles. We bring in $L_t$ and write $w=L_t+2\theta$ with $\theta$ depicted below.

{:.centerr}
<figure>
    <img src="/images/tank_problem/tank_4.png" alt="image" style="width: 50%;">
</figure>

To determine $\theta$, we recognize two similar right triangles. At the bottom base, we decompose $L_b$ into $L_t$ plus $L_b-L_t$; half of the latter must be the base of the largest right triangle we drew. The smaller right triangle has a height of the tank $H$ minus that of the liquid $h$.

{:.centerr}
<figure>
    <img src="/images/tank_problem/tank_5.png" alt="image" style="width: 70%;">
</figure>

Because the triangles are similar, the ratio of the lengths of their two sides are equal:

{:.centerr}
$\dfrac{\theta}{H-h} = \dfrac{(L_b-L_t)/2}{H},$

allowing us to solve for $\theta$ in terms of the geometric properties of the tank and the liquid level. Since the area is $A=(L_t + 2\theta)^2$, we arrive at:

{:.centerr}
$A(h) = \left[\frac{h}{H} L_t + \left(1-\frac{h}{H}\right)L_b \right]^2$

The expression inside the brackets $[\cdot]^2$ is $w$. Intuitively, $w$ is a linear interpolation between $L_t$ and $L_b$. As $h\rightarrow 0$, $w$ approaches the bottom base height $L_b$. If $h \rightarrow H$, $w$ approaches the top base height $L_t$. [Some clever folks might write this expression directly, without the similar triangle argument.]

Finally, our expression $A(h)$ for the truncated square pyramidal tank completes the dynamic, differential equation model for the liquid level $h$ in the tank:

{:.centerr}
$\left[\frac{h}{H} L_t + \left(1-\frac{h}{H}\right)L_b \right]^2 \dfrac{dh}{dt}= q_i - c\sqrt{h}$

This differential equation is non-linear. The solution $h(t)$ for a given initial condition $h(t=0)$ and input flow scheme $q_i(t)$ can be obtained numerically e.g. through [DifferentialEquations.jl](http://docs.juliadiffeq.org/latest/).

## Numerical solution

Let's write code in Julia and use DifferentialEquations.jl to numerically approximate the solution to our tank problem when the tank is initially empty ($h(t=0)=0$) and liquid flows into the tank at a constant rate.

First, we load some packages and define our parameters.

{% highlight julia %}
using DifferentialEquations
using PyPlot # for plotting
using LaTeXStrings # for LaTeX strings in plots

PyPlot.matplotlib[:style][:use]("Solarize_Light2") # dope plot style

# specify tank geometry
H = 4.0 # tank height, m
Lb = 5.0 # bottom base length, m
Lt = 2.0 # top base length, m

# specify resistance to flow
c = 1.0 # awkward units

# inlet flow rate (could be funciton of time)
qᵢ = 1.5 # m³/s

# initial liquid level
h₀ = 0.0 
{% endhighlight %}

Second, we use DifferentialEquations.jl to numerically solve the ODE.

{% highlight julia %}
tspan = (0.0, 150.0) # solve for 0 s to 150 s

# area from a helicopter view, m²
A(h, Lt, Lb, H) = (h/H * Lt + (1 - h/H) * Lb) ^ 2

# right-hand-side of ODE
rhs(h, p, t) = (qᵢ - c * sqrt(h)) / A(h, Lt, Lb, H)

# DifferentialEquations.jl syntax
prob = ODEProblem(rhs, h₀, tspan)
sol = solve(prob)
{% endhighlight %}

We next plot the solution.

{% highlight julia %}
t = range(0.0, stop=tspan[2], length=300)
h = sol.(t) # easy as that to compute solution at an array of times!

figure()
axhline(y=H, linestyle="--", color="k")
xlabel(L"$t$, time [s]")
ylabel(L"$h$, liquid level [m]")
plot(t, h, lw=3, color="orange")
{% endhighlight %}

{:.centerr}

The plot above shows the resulting $h(t)$. The horizontal dashed line denotes the tank height $H$. Despite constant flow into the tank, the liquid does not overflow the tank since, if the tank is completely filled ($h=H$), hydrostatic pressure at the bottom drives flow out of the tank faster than the incoming flow rate $q_i$. The liquid level reaches a steady state $\bar{h}$ when the flow rate of liquid into the tank balances the rate at which hydrostatic pressure drives liquid out of the tank:

{:.centerr}
$q_i-c\sqrt{\bar{h}}=0$

Here, with $q_i=1.5$ and $c=1$, the steady state liquid level is $\bar{h}$=2.25 m.
