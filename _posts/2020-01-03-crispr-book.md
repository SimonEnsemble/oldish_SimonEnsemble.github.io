snippet: Jennifer Doudna, in an excerpt from "A Crack in Creation", highlights how the development of the revolutionary CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technology justifies funding fundamental research.

First, I recommend the book "A Crack in Creation: gene editing and the unthinkable power to control evolution" by the pioneer of the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technology, Jennifer Doudna, and her former graduate student, Samuel Sternberg. The book outlines the story of how the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology was developed, discusses its potential to improve human and plant health, and deliberates over ethical questions surrounding its use.

I only want to highlight an excerpt at the very end of the book:

> One [of Silicon Valley's greatest technology gurus] said, "Give me ten to twenty million dollars and a team of smart people, and we can solve virtually any engineering challenge." This person obviously knew a thing or two about solving technological problems-- a long string of successes attested to that-- but ironically, such an approach would not have produced the CRISPR-based gene-editing technology, which was inspired by curiosity-driven research into natural phenomena. The technology we ended up creating did not take anywhere near ten to twenty million dollars to develop, but it *did* require a thorough understanding of the chemistry and biology of bacterial adaptive immunity, a topic that may seem wholly unrelated to gene editing. This is but one example of the importance of fundamental research-- the pursuit of science for the sake of understanding our natural world-- and its relevance to developing new technologies. Nature, after all, has had a lot more time than humans to conduct experiments! 

> Humans need to keep exploring the world around us through open-ended scientific research. The wonders of penicillin would never have been discovered had Alexander Fleming not been conducting simple experiments with Staphylococci bacteria. Recombinant DNA research-- the foundation for modern molecular biology-- became possible only with the isolation of DNA-cutting and DNA-copying enzymes from gut- and heat-loving bacteria. Rapid DNA sequencing required experiments on the remarkable properties of bacteria from hot springs. And my colleagues and I would never have created a powerful gene-editing tool if we hadnâ€™t tackled the much more fundamental question of how bacteria fight off viral infections.
